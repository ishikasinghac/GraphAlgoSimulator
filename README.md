**Graph Algo Simulator** is a web application designed to help users visualize typical graph searching algorithms. This interactive tool enables users to understand and explore various algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), A*, Dijkstra, and Greedy BFS through engaging animations and intuitive UI.

**💻Live Demo** [Website Link](https://graphalgosimulator.netlify.app/)

## ✨ Features

- **Visualize Graph Algorithms**: Observe how different algorithms traverse paths.
- **Interactive Interface**: Click and drag to add source, destination, and blockers to create graphs, add nodes, and visualize the pathfinding process.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Choose from DFS, BFS, A*, Dijkstra, and Greedy BFS to see how each algorithm operates on the same graph.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Watch each algorithm's progress in real-time, making it easier to comprehend their mechanics.
- **Customizable Graphs**: Users can modify the graph by adding or removing obstacles and changing source or destination to see how algorithms behave with different configurations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web app.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionalities and algorithm implementations.
